USAGE IN PROJECT:
-----------------
- Appears in select flight plans (~5-8% of missions)
- Used for heavy cargo and industrial deliveries
- Specialized missions requiring high payload capacity

REAL-WORLD REFERENCE:
---------------------
Based on DJI M300 RTK specifications

================================================================================
COMMON FEATURES ACROSS ALL MODELS
================================================================================

SAFETY SYSTEMS:
---------------
Collision Detection Radius:     15.0 meters (30m diameter safety zone)
Waypoint Arrival Threshold:     5.0 meters
Collision Response:              Detection and logging (no avoidance)

NAVIGATION SYSTEMS:
-------------------
Route Planning:                  WebSocket-based with server communication
Fallback System:                 None - flights cancelled if no route received
Movement Type:                   Holonomic (direct waypoint following)

FLIGHT PHASES:
--------------
1. Takeoff    - Climb to cruise altitude (60% max speed)
2. Cruise     - Full speed flight at cruise altitude
3. Approach   - Reduce speed for landing preparation (70% max speed)
4. Landing    - Slow descent to destination (40% max speed)
5. Return     - Reverse route back to origin

BATTERY MANAGEMENT:
-------------------
- Dynamic power consumption based on speed
- Speed factor formula: 1.0 + (current_speed / max_speed) * 0.5
- Real-time battery monitoring
- Mission abort on battery depletion

WAYPOINT SYSTEM:
----------------
- Server-requested routes via WebSocket
- 90-second timeout - flight cancelled if no route received
- Drones only fly if Python server provides valid route (status: "success")
- All failure cases (timeout, no_path, error, invalid JSON) cancel flight
- Intermediate waypoints for flights > 5km (one per 10km) - only in server-provided routes
- Altitude management for different flight phases
