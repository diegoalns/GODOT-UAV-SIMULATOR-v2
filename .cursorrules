# Godot UAV Simulator - Cursor Rules

## Documentation-First Development Workflow

⚠️ CRITICAL: After ANY code modification, ALWAYS check and update:
- ARCHITECTURE.md (if architecture/components changed)
- README.md (if features/usage changed)
This is MANDATORY, not optional.

AFTER CODE CHANGES - MANDATORY CHECKLIST:
[ ] Updated ARCHITECTURE.md if component responsibilities changed
[ ] Updated README.md if user-facing features changed
[ ] Verified documentation matches code
[ ] Updated "Last Updated" timestamps if applicable


After completing code changes:
1. List what files were modified
2. For each modified file, check if ARCHITECTURE.md or README.md need updates
3. Update
